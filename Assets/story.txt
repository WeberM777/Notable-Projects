Rudee is glad.
It is Krathong Day.
Rudee made a Krathong.
Rudee made her Krathong with banana leaves.
Have you ever made a Krathong with banana leaves?
Rudee put pink flowers on her Krathong.
Rudee likes pink.
What color do you like?

Lamon is sad.
He moved to Surant Thani today.
Lamon made a Krathong.
His brother helped him.
Lamon made his Krathong with bread.
Have you ever made a Krathong with bread?
Lamon will make a wish today.
He will make a wish at the river.
Have you made a wish on Loy Krathong Day?

The moon is bright.
The river has Krathongs in it.
They are in a line.
There are people in the river.
They put Krathongs in a line.
There are candles in the Krathongs.
The candles are bright.

Rudee puts her Krathong in the river.
There is music.
There is dancing.
Rudee says her wish as she puts her Krathong in the river.
Lamon puts his Krathong in the river.
Krathong Day is not the same as it was in his old home.
But, his Krathong is the same.
Lamon says his wish.
 “I wish I had a friend.”
Rudee hears Lamon make his wish.
Rudee says, “Hello. I like your Krathong.”
Lamon says, “I like your Krathong, too.”
Rudee says, “I like pink.”
Lamon says, “I like pink too.”
Lamon is glad that his wish came true.
